# Snowpack + React + Bulma SCSS

I made this so i can avoid wasting 1 hour each time i create a new project, since 70% of them uses this exact template.
And also i have a memory of a fish, so i end up forgetting how i did stuff.

feel free to contribute if you feel like something is missing.

## How to use

```git
npm i 
```

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.
